                <li>Now add your tomato paste and sauce right after, be sure to work it into the veggies and salami as best you can - then add 1/2 cup of your pasta water.</li>
                <li>Now that the sauce is ready, add cooked spaghetti and gently fold into the sauce until all of the noodle is coated with the spaghetti sauce.</li>
