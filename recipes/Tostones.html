        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 green plantains</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil or canola oil as needed</li>
                <li>4 Cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to top</li>
                <li>6 limes</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>cut and peal your plantains - cut the ends, then slice through the middle, and pry the skin off</li>
                <li>cut the bare plantain into round medallions</li>
                <li>fill a deep skillet with about 1cm of oil</li>
                <li>while your pan warms, mix 1/2cup of water, garlic, kosher salt, and lime juice</li>
                <li>now add your plantains to the pan with oil - flipping them over after 5 minutes</li>
                <li>once both sides have been cooked for 5 minutes per medallion you will need to bring them out of the pan</li>
                <li>next use the bottom of a glass, and gently flatten each medallion</li>
                <li>once flattened, you will need to add each of the medallions back into the pan to be fried for an additional 1 minutes each</li>
                <li>now transfer them to a paper towel lined plate</li>
                <li>sprinkle a little salt on them, bring out the sauce you made with the garlic and lime juice and BAM!</li>
            </ol>
