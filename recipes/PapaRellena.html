                <li class="li">2lb russet potatoes - peeled and chopped into 8ths</li>
                <li class="li">water</li>
                <li class="li">1/4 cup of oat milk</li>
                <li class="li">2 tsp chopped garlic</li>
                <li class="li">1 cup of chopped peppers</li>
                <li class="li"> 1 diced yellow onion</li>
                <li class="li">1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li class="li">pepper to taste</li>
                <li class="li">1lb ground beef</li>
                <li class="li">1 cup bread crumbs</li>
                <li class="li">2 eggs</li>
                <li class="li"> sunflower oil or vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h4 class="heading">Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="li">First we are going to make or filling, by adding oil to a deep and wide skillet, and browning our ground beef.</li>
                <li class="li">Add - salt, garlic, chopped peppers to your ground beef, and saute until onions are clear.</li>
                <li class="li">So now we make the potatoes, I use a regular pot and hot water - so in an pot I add enough water to cover my chopped potatoes, and then wait 15 minutes until the potatoes are easily pierced by a fork.</li>
                <li class="li">Once, the potatoes are tender, drain the water and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes.</li>
                <li class="li">Once, the mashed potatoes are chunky - add the milk, garlic, salt and pepper. Use the masher to mash until the potatoes are smooth.</li>
                <li class="li">In your hand, use about 2 tbsp of mashed potatoes. Form them into your hand, in a bowl shape. Place a spoonful of your ground beef mix in the center of the bowl. Fold the mashed potatoes over, closing the picadillo inside.</li>
                <li class="li">In a separate bowl, whisk up an egg.</li>
                <li class="li">Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl.</li>
                <li class="li">Now the magic begins - roll each mashed potato ball in the whisked egg. Then roll it in the breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li class="li">Finally, heat another pan with oil to about 375 degrees, and place each breaded mashed potato ball in the oil and allow to fry for about 2 minutes on each side until it turns golden brown. Enjoy</li>
